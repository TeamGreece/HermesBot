# Hermes Discord Bot
Hermes is a _discord bot_ that was initially made for the _official Te@mGreece Discord server_.  

## Whats new in Hermes Bot:
We utilized the Discord API, so we can use features such as slash commands, buttons and dropdown menus to make the user experience more friendly.  

## Features:
### Meeting Feature
/meeting set: Creates a meeting, so other members can show availability by pressing the buttons given.  
/meeting view: The user can see all the meetings he has authored, as well as the status other members have submitted.  
### Poll Feature
/poll create: Creates a poll with the objects given. Users can then select one of them via the dropdown menu.  
/poll view: The user can see the polls he has authored, as well as reactions of other members illustrated in a chart.  


## How to use:
You will need to create a file named .env in the main directory, and the content should be:  
TOKEN=yourtokenhere    
You will also need to change the guildId, appId and file id variables so it works for your server.
